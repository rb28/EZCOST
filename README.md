# INTRODUCTION

**EZCost** is an opensource costing app built using _R_ which has been developed specifically for the purpose of preparing Reference Costs and Patient Level Costs returns in Acute NHS Hospitals. 

The project was borne out of a sense of frustration with the proprietary costing software currently on offer and seeks to address most, if not all the common failings experienced with the current crop of costing software. It is designed to make the costing process  completely transparent and makes every attempt to adhere strictly to best practices and the latest _NHSI_ costing standards.

The hope is that this project will encourage & inspire other NHS costing analysts to:
* Learn and adopt R as the tool of choice for data analysis.
* Explore other potential uses of data analytics in Healthcare. 
* Kickstart their own costing projects for implementing the _NHSI_ PLICS costing standards without undue reliance on third parties.
